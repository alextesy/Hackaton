This project was done in two extensive days as part of the HackBGU 2018 competition and won 3rd place!!. 
The hackathon was focused on innovation and creativity in the learning and teaching experience.

Our solution "Present Simple" aims to automatically take boring presentations to the next level.
To do so we used three steps:
1) Analyse each slide of the presentation.
2) Find external interactive content on the internet.
3) Inject the best findings into the slides.

The result is an interactive PPTX presentation in seconds.

This helping tool was aimed to help professors and teaching assistants to make their lessons more interactive and less exhausting for both the students and the lecturers.

The team: Shaked Eyal, Alex Kremiansky, Tal Ben-Senior, and myself.
